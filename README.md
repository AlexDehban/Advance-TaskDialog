# Advance-TaskDialog
This is a Custom TaskDialog with getting theme automatically, opposite the original one(TTaskDialog)!

TTaskDialog  is a non-visual component, which shows full-featured dialog at run-time, introduced in Delphi 2009.
A task dialog is somewhat like the standard message dialog in the VCL but we can also add extra buttons, check-boxes, radio buttons besides the usual default sets of buttons like OK, Cancel, Yes, No. 
It is possible to set caption, normal title and long wrapped text as title for dialog also but the big problem is that when you apply a VCL Style theme to your application it won't be applied to the original TTaskDialog,
even in Windows itself this dialog is not themed yet (Win 11!).

This library has two benefits :
  1- It will get the current theme automatically.
  2- It has supported a textbox to get user's input which is not implemented by the original one.
  3- It is basically a winform despite the original one which is inherited from TComponent.
  4- It has a 3 part hyperlink section in footer(see the samples).



## Remarks:<br>
You need to have the Konopka Signature VCL Controls (formerly Raize Components) which is free these days in any version of the IDE except the comunity edition.
The Konopka Components can be downloaded and installed via GetIt, although it is possible that they are only included in the latest version but probably not in the Starter Edition, The free Bonus Pack is only available to licensed owners of the following products: RAD Studio, Delphi or C++Builder 10.1 Berlin( or higher) Professional, Enterprise and Architect editions.
