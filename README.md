# Advance-TaskDialog
A Custom TaskDialog with getting theme automatically, opposite the original one!

TTaskDialog  is a non-visual component, which shows full-featured dialog at run-time which introduced in Delphi 2009. A task dialog is somewhat like the standard message dialog in the VCL but we can also add extra buttons, check-boxes, radio buttons besides the usual default sets of buttons like OK, Cancel, Yes, No. We can set caption, normal title and long wrapped text as title for dialog also but the big problem is that when you apply a VCL theme then VCL style will be applied to Delphi application but it won't apply to original TaskDialog.
This library has to benefits :
  1- It will get theme automatically.
  2- It has supported a textbox to get user's input which is not implemented by the original one.
